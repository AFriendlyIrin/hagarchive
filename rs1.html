<div>I must concur... I had nearly

<div>edward</div>
<div><i>(smiles)</i> So, was I right or was I right?
It was a good idea to make a stop!</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>Indeed. However, now is the time

<div>edward</div>
<div>Yeah, yeah, I hear ya.
All right, let's...</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Hey, what's all the ruckus

<div>eudoxus</div>
<div><i>(smiling)</i> Come one, come all, and heed
my words,<br>
for I am the great merchant,
Eudoxus!<p>
The roads are treacherous these days,
ladies and gentlemen.<br>
Have you never pondered how much
safer you'd feel,<br>
if you had not neglected to hire
protectors before you set out?<br>
Let woe consume you not, for I bring
the solution to your plight!<br>
These here mercenaries are the cream
of the crop!<br>
Hire them to never again know the
meaning of the word “danger”!</p><p>
And because I am a truly selfless soul,
a deal of value unparalleled!<br>
Hire your first for free, and the second
at a discount!<br>
Thus says the great merchant, Eudoxus.
Now!<br>
Step up to the plate, and don't be shy!
I shall hear all bids!</p></div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>That was the worst sales pitch
I've heard in my life.</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div><i>(smirks)</i> Hey, that takes a special kind of talent

<div>pericles</div>
<div>Still, this is a rather curious instance of

This is precisely what we were seeking
in crossing the border.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Yeah, that's true... Think any
of these goons are any good?</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Since we can take one for free,

Let's just get the special first.</div>

Hire him. Please.<br>
Custom-made, he says.
Hahahahahaha!</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>...Compared to your average ruffian,
he should be able to soak some blows.<br>
But the armor is clearly not properly
adjusted, and is in a state of disrepair.</div>
<div>fructuoso</div>
<div>Y-Yeah, I won't lie, it kinda
hurts to move with this on...</div>

Honestly, can't fault the lad for

No good. No good.</div>

Want something skewered and
skewered fast, call on me.</div>

<div>Mm... They do look rather quick on the
uptake. Competent, too.<br>
Probably the most experienced fighter
of the bunch.<br>
Which isn't necessarily a good thing.
Who knows who this person really is...</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>The fact is, we need allies, and
they seem like a good option.<br>
We can always keep a close watch

If they attempt anything untoward,
we may act,<br>

of their foolish actions.</div>
