				<div>The United Margravates of
Glamorgan is a coalition of
territories that seceded from
Tartaros nearly 200 years ago.<br>
It is Tartaros's southernmost
bordering neighbor, and their
relations have historically been,
at best, tense.<br>
Glamorgan does not share
Tartaros's animosity towards so
called heresy. They have, in the
past, granted asylum to refugees.<br>
At present, the theocracy and the
union maintain an uneasy peace,
not having warred for the last two
decades...</div>

<div>kyra</div>
<div>How many times have I gone hunting in
this forest?<br>
Now I am the one being hunted, and who
knows when I'll see these woods again.</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>Do not lose hope. The time
of your return will come.<br>
And this time, your brother
will be healthy.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Gee, how encouraging of you.<br>
You don't need to lay it on that thick,
you know? You got me already.<br>
You can stop with the manipulation
tactics.</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>...Think of me what you will.
You are doing the right thing.<br>
That is just the truth.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>If you say so.
<p class="stagedirection">(Edward and Pericles approach.)</p></div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Kyra! You hear all the rustling?<br>
It's driving the folks nuts...
And I'll admit, me too!</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>There's always rustling in
the woods, Redbeard.<br>
Don't get antsy. We need
to stick together.</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>Are you certain you know where
we are going, Dame Kyra?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Please. I know this forest like the palm of
my hand.<br>
I don't usually stray this far, but I know
which direction the border is.</div>
				<div></div>
				<div><img src="tartaros_ch06.png"/></div>
				<div>Kyra</div>
<div>We keep going this way and we'll
be at the bank of the Lesmosyne.<br>
Then we'll just have to make our
way downstream to the frontier.</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>...And you can assure me that the
rustling is no cause for concern?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Unless you're afraid of boars, no.<br>
Although you should be. If we find
a boar, be sure not to--</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>Kyra, this is too much noise for
animals in the wilderness.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>And how would you know it?<p>
...Wait... I think I hear it too now.<br>
Metal clanking...</p></div>

<div>pericles</div>
<div>Confound it! They found us!</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>What? There's no way they managed
to set up an ambush already!<br>
The woods are large and we could've
headed in any direction!</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>True, but the Grand Inquisitor is unlikely
to have been resting on her laurels.<br>
No doubt she placed a price on our
heads before we even left that fort.<br>
That would prompt many to scour the
forest, seeking our trail.</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Yeah, got to be bounty hunters. Desperate
enough to blindly search the woods.<br>
Looks like it's their lucky day...
or unlucky.</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>Let us make it their most unfortunate!
To battle, Dame Kyra!</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>I'll stick to the back and keep our
things and Eli safe.</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>Then I shall do the same.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>I doubt these morons are in
their element out here.<br>
Let's ensnare them in their

<div>Before our paths collided, I was

I was making a special bow.

shouldn't take me too long.<br>
