Ever heard of the word “please”?</div>

<div>At my age, as you put it, I have

It is not to be wasted, much less

<div>I must concur with the here--
Er, with Lady Apate.<br>
We have a momentous task ahead

<div>All right, smarty-pants, then
answer me a question.<br>
Do you know who rules over
this little slice of heaven?</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>If I recall, the current margrave's
name is Barlowe.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Oh!
Barlowe?<br>
You're good friends with a Glamorgan
guy called Barlowe, right?</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div><i>(smiles)</i> Eyup. This Barlowe, to be precise.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>You never mentioned he was the margrave
of the neighboring territory.</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Didn't come up, I guess.</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>That's it? We are going to try to sway
a foreign leader to our side?<br>
I know we came to Glamorgan seeking
allies, but...<br>
Primarily, I was thinking of hiring some
mercenaries.<br>
Involving the margrave? I don't feel
comfortable with that.<br>
This is our battle, Edward!
Not Glamorgan's!</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>You done? If you've got any better
ideas, I'm all ears.<p>
Look, I can't exactly guarantee we'll
get anything outta this.<br>
But the man's brilliant. He used to be
a quite famous strategist.<br>
With his help, we could accomplish
anything, I know it.<br>
And he is a genuinely good man.
I can promise you that.<br>
If nothing else, I'm sure he'll offer us
his hospitality.<br>
It's as good a place to start as any,
right?</p></div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>Good.
That is all I wanted to know.<br>
Well? Did it kill you to be
forthcoming with us?</div>

<div><i>(smiles)</i> Ah, pardon me. Tiresias often tells me I need
to stop being such a stick-in-the-mud.<br>
<i>(serious)</i> But I am not a nobleman. Not truly.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>You aren't?
That's a surprise.<br>
Do you just like talking
like that, then?</div>
<div>wulfric</div>
<div>...It's a long story.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Oh.</div>
<div>wulfric</div>
<div>That aside, I truly am most
grateful.<br>
It has been a long time since
I could rest easy.<br>
Knowing that Tiresias is safe
among friends...<br>
We've been alone on the road
for far too long.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>How did you two meet, anyway?
You're Glamorgan, right?</div>
<div>wulfric</div>
<div>He and a small cohort of like-minded
individuals fled Tartaros years ago.<br>
You can probably hazard a guess as
to their reasons.<br>
But those uncaring monsters, they
were so worried for their own skin...<br>
They marched at speed. Tiresias fell
behind, and they... abandoned him.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Is that when you found him?
Lucky break...</div>
<div>wulfric</div>
<div>No. I found the mangled bodies of
his fellow escapees.<br>
Brigands fell upon them. Ironically,
being left behind saved Tiresias.<br>
One of them had some strength left.
He begged me to seek him out.<br>
So I did. Fortunately he hadn't
wandered too far from the path.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>And you've been together
ever since...</div>
<div>wulfric</div>
<div>I had not a home nor anybody to call
a loved one, and neither did he.<br>
<i>(smiles)</i> Tiresias... He is a wonderful person.
You can already tell, right?<br>
He could be cursing the Mother,
or anyone else, for his misfortune.<br>
Instead he is quick with a joke,
a smile and a hearty laugh.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div><i>(smiles)</i> Only because he has a faithful
companion to guide him along.<br>
I can tell that, too. He doesn't
need his sight when he has you.</div>
<div>wulfric</div>
<div>......<br>
Please, Kyra, don't hesitate to let me
know how I can be of help.</div>

You don't have to worry about a

We get folks running away from

He has always been so kind to us.
Who could want to hurt him...?<br>
Here, this spear belonged to my

If I'm not mistaken, all three of their

There's no way that's a coincidence,
right?<br>

I know you're here somewhere!<br>
Come out of your hidey-hole and

<div>I should have known. Trouble attracts
you like flames attract the moth.

Grrr...</p></div>

<div>kyra</div>
<div>...Edward, what is happening?
Should I be worried?</div>
<div></div><div class="stagedirection">(Edward guffaws.)</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div><i>(smiling)</i> Gehahahahahaha! You haven't changed
at all, Barlowe, you old oaf!</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div><i>(smiling)</i> Oh, shut your mouth, you incorrigible
miscreant.<br>
It's so good to see you again.</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Been way too long, man.</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>But what in the world brings you
back?<br>
I thought you'd found yourself a
nice, cozy gig in Tartaros!</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Ahh, you know how it is.
Nothing lasts forever.<br>
Oh, but let me introduce
you to Kyra here...</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Ah, you are she?<br>
Edward spoke so much of you in
his letters.<br>
Quite highly, at that, and I see
that he was not exaggerating.<br>
Your tactics were unrefined, but
no less effective for it.<br>
Such a capable commander, at
such a young age...<br>
Oh, it's enough to tug at my
nostalgic heartstrings.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Ah, well, I...</div>
<div></div><div class="stagedirection">(The other margraves approach.)</div>
<div>zaccheus</div>
<div>So it is to you that we
owe our lives?<br>
You do not look like
much...<br>
Do you even speak
our language?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>...What...?</div>
<div>simeon</div>
<div>You will pardon me if I do not waste
time on expressions of gratitude.<br>
Many tasks await me, and this delay
has been most unwelcome.<br>
I must ride back to my lands,
post-haste.</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Indeed, I would see the three
of you off sooner than later.<br>
I shall figure out which of you
is the culprit in due time.</div>
<div>delilah</div>
<div>What?! Have you gone senile over
the course of the battle, Barlowe?<br>
Since clearly you have forgotten,
let me refresh your aging memory.<br>
All three of us were trapped in this
castle with you!<br>
You truly think us so stupid as to
sic assassins on ourselves?!</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>No, I think you intelligent enough to make it
appear as though you were at risk also.<br>
But you three stand to gain the most from
my untimely demise. This is fact.<br>
Please, feel free to save us all the hassle
of a tedious investigation. Anyone?</div>
<div>delilah</div>
<div><i>(smiriks)</i> Hah! Not even a brush with death can quell
the great tactician's imagination.<br>
Hey, if it makes you feel better to imagine
some grand conspiracy, be my guest.<br>
<i>(scowls)</i> Ready my carriage! I burn with desire to
abandon this hovel.</div>
<div>simeon</div>
<div>You will admit your accusations are
devoid of all logic and reason.<br>
But I suppose you need to save face
after that disgraceful failure.<br>
Your old reputation is in a precarious
enough position as it is.<br>
That's just as well. As for me, I have
more important things to do.</div>
<div>zaccheus</div>
<div>Even the whelp has more sense than
you do, Barlowe.<br>
Truly I do so pity the poor people stuck
with you as their margrave.<br>
Go ahead, keep embarrassing yourself
as much as you like.<br>
I shall leave you to it.
Ta-ta.</div>
<div></div><div class="stagedirection">(The margraves leave.)</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>...Amazing bunch of pals
you got there.</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Politics, Kyra. I would not wish them
on my worst enemy.<br>
...But let's talk about you. Surely this
is not merely a courtesy call?</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Truth is, we got something important
to talk with you about.<br>
Bit of a long story.
You'd better sit down.</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Hmm... I would speak with Kyra,
if you don't mind, Edward.<br>
You I know well. I should like to
get acquainted with her.<br>
Her and her companion in the
white robe, if she's willing.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Wait, Apate? Why?</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Let us speak in my study.
It is this way.<br>
I shall await you and your
ally there.</div>
<div></div><div class="stagedirection">(Barlowe leaves.)</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>...He's got to be a slippery one, if he
has survived dealing with that rabble.</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Slippery's one word to describe him.<br>
But trust me, he's a good man.
Just be earnest with him, okay?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>......</div>
			</div>
			<div class="container transition">
<div>kyra</div>
<div>...And thus, Edward brought us
here to see you.</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>A rebellion to depose the hierophant
himself, huh... A complex problem.<br>
Knowing what I know of you, I would
be foolish to speak down to you.<br>
I shall outline the facts as succinctly
as I am able.
<p>
Surely you understand that I cannot
simply declare war on Tartaros.<br>
The margravates have a great deal
of freedom, but there are limits.<br>
I would never be allowed to interfere
in a Tartaran affair.</p></div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Yeah, that's reasonable.<br>
We won't ask for anything other
than a place to stay for a while.</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>You get ahead of yourself, Kyra.
I never refused you.<br>
It is imperative, however, that we handle
this matter with care.<br>
Indeed, I cannot justify poking my nose
in the internal affairs of Tartaros...<br>
Not without the right story to go with it,
at the very least.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>What do you mean?</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Let us say that you do us a favor.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>We already saved your life!</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>We need not convince the margrave,
Kyra. He is clearly already on our side.<br>
It is his troops, his people, and most
importantly, his peers we must sway.</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Keenly observed.
Most perspicacious of you, my lady.<br>
A situation so... unorthodox, as what
transpired today, would not do.<br>
Rumors would swirl. People would wonder
what manner of hold you have over me.<br>
No, what we need is a simple, palatable
tale of heroism and justice.<br>
Something akin to a fairy tale, that even
children could grasp - and support.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Yeah, I get what you mean now...<br>
Well, we're at your disposal. What
would you have us do, Margrave?</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div><i>(smiles)</i> Barlowe, please. You are Edward's
dear friend, thus mine as well.</div>
<div></div><div><img src="glamorgan_ch08.png"></div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>You see, we have had some
trouble with a certain group.<br>
They hide in a derelict mansion
at the base of the mountains.<br>
They demand tithes of the
settlements in north Wrexham.<br>
...In absence of payment, they have sworn
to unleash an army of the “undead.”<br>
So far they have been mostly ignored,
and their threats ring hollow.<br>
Nevertheless, however likely it is to be
no more than bluster, it worries me.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>So, bandit clean-up? That used to be our
specialty, before his whole thing started.</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Theirs are the acts of brigands, true.<br>
However, their leader is, uh...
Well, there is no easy way to put this.<br>
He claims to not be merely a powerful
sorcerer, but rather, a “necromancer.”<br>
Somebody capable of returning the
dead back to their mortal coil...</div>
<div></div><div class="stagedirection">(Apate starts.)</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>What?!</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Does that seem surprising to you,
one who can also restore life?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>So you know about that too.</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div><i>(smiles)</i> I had a good vantage point during the
battle.<br>
My best guess is that our “necromancer”
is another of the so-called heretics.<br>
I wished to ask for Lady Apate's input
on this regard, but...</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>...I cannot tell you anything
without more information.<br>
It is best that we see about
this individual for ourselves.<br>
But would dealing with them
be enough for our purposes?</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>It would do to begin.
<p>
...Ah, Fiadh. There you are.
You arrive just in time.</p></div>
<div></div><div class="stagedirection">(Fiadh enters.)</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>...The scum have returned to the
earth, where they belong.<br>
Those who lived will never come
back. They are finished.</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Are you uninjured, Fiadh?<br>
Lady Apate, would you tend
to her injuries for me?</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>Margrave, I am the bodyguard.
It's me who looks after you.<br>
Besides, I'm perfectly fine.
Just tell me what's next.<br>
Which of those backstabbing
pigs are we taking on first?</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Do you recall the reports
about the necromancer?</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>...No. I can't believe it.<br>
They just tried to kill you! The assassins'
blood is fresh on the ground!<br>
And you want me to go chasing after
that idiotic gossip?!</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Our new friends here shall assist
you in that task.<br>
In the meantime, I shall personally
investigate today's agitation.</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>Let them go alone!
Why do I have to go?<br>
They could try again!
I need to stay at your side!</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Fiadh... I request that you place
your trust in my judgment.</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>......<br>
Okay. What's the worst that
can happen?<br>
You. I'll take you to where
those imbeciles are at.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Just give me the time to gather
my guys and we can get going.</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>No time like the present.
Make it quick.</div>
<div>barlowe</div>
<div>Best of luck to you,
my friends...</div>
