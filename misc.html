		<div data-role="collapsible" class="collapsible" data-collapsed="true"><h1>Guide</h1>
		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>Certain mechanics might
not work exactly as you
expect in this game.<br>
Peruse in the ingame
<font color="red">guide</font> for clarification
on such details.<br>
The guide will not be
updated as the game
progresses.</p>
		<h3>Poison the Well</h3>
		<p>Poison is slightly stronger
than usual here, dealing 3-6
damage per turn. Be careful
with your poisoned units!</p>
		<h3>Kiss the Boo-boo</h3>
		<p>Healing sources, as the
premise might indicate,
are more limited here
than usual.</p>
<p>
Forts, thrones and gates
no longer heal units
standing on them.
</p><p>
Vulneraries still exist, but
they're more expensive.
Them's the breaks.</p>
		<h3>Unfamiliar Familiarity</h3>
		<p>Most changes made to
weapon numbers in this game
are small and easy to adapt to.
</p><p>
However, the anima tree in
particular has been greatly
overhauled.
</p><p>
Be careful - those tomes
may not function exactly
as you expect!
</p><p>
There is also no magic trinity.
No magic type has an innate
advantage over another.
</p><p>
Beyond that, there are new
weapons, items, classes...
When in doubt, never forget
to press R!</p>
		<h3>Soups and Ports</h3>
		<p>Supports cannot be obtained
in the same manner as in the
classic games.</p>

<p>Don't waste time stapling units
next to one another, for that
will do nothing.</p>

<p>Supports are instead unlocked
by different means. More on
that later!</p>
		<h3>Superb Rank!</h3>
		<p>Having an S-rank, like
in the base game, grants
stat bonuses when using
that weapon type.</p>

<p>However, the bonuses
are different: It is +1 might
and +5 hit. Be careful!</p>
		<h3>Skillful Bunch</h3>
		<p>You will never learn a skill
in this game by levelling up
or using an item. <i>[Editor's Note: This is not true. Plato learns skills by level up.]</i>
</p><p>
Instead, each promoted
infantry class (plus some
mounted classes) has an
assigned skill.
</p><p>
Certain characters will also
have a personal skill, but
this is not common.
</p><p>
In rare cases, characters or
classes might have multiple
skills.
</p><p>
All mounted classes have
basic Canto, even if it's not
specified.</p>
		<h3>Training Manual</h3>
		<p>What follows is a list of
weapon EXP yields, which are
slightly different in this game.
</p><p>
Any weapon not listed below
gives 1 WEXP per hit.
WEXP gains are doubled on kill.
</p><p>
2 WEXP:<br>
Steels (and magic equivalents),
luna, blades, rapier-tier, reavers,
slayers, hammer, cleave bow.
</p><p>
4 WEXP:<br>
Siege tomes.<br>
Devil weapons.
</p><p>
E rank: 1 WEXP<br>
D rank: 31 WEXP<br>
C rank: 71 WEXP<br>
B rank: 121 WEXP<br>
A rank: 181 WEXP<br>
S rank: 251 WEXP<br></p>
		<h3>Qualities of Life</h3>
		<p>Trading, accessing the
supply and talking do
not end the unit's turn.
</p><p>
When player units die, their
items are sent to the convoy
if there is enough room in it.
</p><p>
Hold L to manually skip
animations if they're
enabled, and viceversa.
</p><p>
Press Select on the map
to view the attack range
of all enemies combined.
</p><p>
Press Select on a unit's
statsheet to see their
growth rates.
</p><p>
Promotion options for
each class are listed
in the class description.
</p><p>
Promotion gains are
listed in the promotion
screen.</p>
		<h3>Have fun!</h3>
		<p>No, uh, yeah, that's it.
I just hope you have fun!</p>
		<h3>I lied</h3>
		<p>The guide did update
again after all.
Womp womp.</p>
<p>
Anyway this is just the
postgame explanation
so feel free to disregard.
</p><p>
The postgame works on
a loop - when you finish
it, you will return here.
</p><p>
You will also be given
the option to return to
the start after completing
each level, if you want.
</p><p>
Every time, on this first
level, all absent units,
be dead or unrecruited,
will be returned to you.
</p><p>
No units are force
deployed, and Kyra and
Apate no longer cause
a game over on death.
On seize maps, any unit
may seize.
</p><p>
You may also visit camp.
where every conversation
in the game is available
to be read.
</p><p>
It is advised to restart
camp after viewing any
one unit's convos to
avoid potential issues.
</p><p>
Lastly, you may recruit
a number of bonus units,
but these will not
appear at camp.</p>
