					<div>Well, here we are.
Lady Begoña's grand estate.<br>
Not much to look at, is it?</div>
					<div>soter</div>
					<div>This fort was built during one of the
old wars with Glamorgan.<br>
Its purpose, to defend this once vital
point, so close to the border.<br>
...With the years, however, it fell into
neglect and disrepair.</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>And now it only serves to give lawless
thugs a roof to cower under.</div>
					<div>phobos</div>
					<div>S-Still, a fort's a fort.<br>
There's a reason we've not been able
to take out Begoña for good...<br>
What makes you think we'll win this
time, Kyra?</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>This time, I'm really angry.<br>
I'll climb the walls if I must.
I'm taking her down.<br>
She'll rue the day she ordered the
town where I grew up razed!</div>
					<div>hecate</div>
					<div>Sheesh... Never seen this side of
you before, Kyra.<br>
If Begoña's not quaking in her
boots, she's a downright idiot.</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>Jury's still out on that one.</div>
					<div>soter</div>
					<div>Please, my friend, please!
Let us temper our nerves!<br>
I completely understand your
fury. This I swear.<br>
Yet you must let it haunt you
not, lest it cost you dearly!<br>
What we do today, we do for
justice, not vengeance!</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>...Yeah.
Right... You're right.</div>
					<div>phobos</div>
					<div><i>(smiles)</i> Phew... I was afraid Soter's pompous

					<div>W-What?!
Pompous, me?!</div>
					<div>hecate</div>
					<div><i>(smiling)</i> Ahahahaha! What, are you going to
deny it?<br>
Even the knights I knew back in the
capital weren't as uptight as you.</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>All right, that's enough! Get in there
before they have a chance to react.</div>
					<div>hecate</div>
					<div>Aye aye, chief!</div>

					<div>This is where those brigands
take shelter?<br>
It looks rather... derelict.</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>Soter told me once that they built this
fort during a war with Glamorgan.<br>
The forest wasn't so dense at the time.
It was important to keep them at bay.<br>
...But it's been a long time since then.
No one's used it in decades.<br>
No one but these loathsome thugs...</div>
					<div>apate</div>
					<div>Nevertheless, it is still a fort.<br>
This building was designed to stop
armies - what is our plan, Kyra?</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>Get in there and drag Begoña
out of her stolen throne.</div>
					<div>apate</div>
					<div>...That is not a plan, Kyra.<br>
You would do well to calm
down before we start.</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>Sigh... I know, I know.<br>
Still, we can't well let her roam
free if she's growing bolder.<br>
We'll figure it out as we go.
Let's do this!</div>
					<div>apate</div>
					<div>...Good enough, I suppose...</div>
