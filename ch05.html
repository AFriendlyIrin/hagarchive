to us.<br>

you high-and-mighty...</div>

form up at the doors!</div>
				<div>narrator</div>
				<div>Starting this chapter, you
can <font color="red">go to the army's camp</font>
from the preparations
screen.<br>
There, you can speak to
allies or overhear their
conversations to get to
know them better.<br>
This may yield a multitude
of rewards, primarily
support levels and
stat gains.<br>
Hestia, the blacksmith, will
also be found there - the
preparations store has
been unlocked.<br>
She might also have other
things in store for you.
Make sure to pay visits to
her often!<br>
Lastly, you can use the
<font color="red">!</font> icon at camp to change
your difficulty settings
at any point.<br>
You can return to the
preparations at any time
by waiting within the areas
marked by blue flames.</div>

barely an hour's march away.<br>
She seemed so interested before.
Why weren't her elite troops here?</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Any ideas, hotshot knight?</div>
<div>Pericles</div>
<div>The Grand Inquisitor was always an...
eccentric person.<br>
She is not feared for her combat
prowess alone.<br>
Perhaps she merely wished to toy
with her prey, as it were.</div>
<div>kyra</div>

<div>kyra</div>
<div>You said that the Grand Inquisitor knew
to take your fancy door-opening stick.<br>
Now it has taken the inquisition all of two
days to find us here, deep in the forest.<br>
And, come to think of it, they sure caught
wind of your arrival in Percote fast.</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>It all paints a clear picture. But will
you continue to avert your gaze?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>...More than anything, this battle...<br>
They wouldn't be toying with us if they
weren't sure they had us trapped.<br>
But right now, the coast is clear.
We can just leave, disappear...<br>
It can only mean one thing.</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>They count on someone among our group
to keep them informed of our movements.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Is this truly how the venerable church
of Tartaros works, Apate?<br>
Deception, subterfuge, cruelty...
Sacrificing lives for nothing...</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>...It is. It always has, and it always will
be if things are left as they stand.<br>
They will torture you, torment you,
and in the end... You will be gone.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>......<br>
Very well. If even they won't
give me time to breathe...<br>
I will do it, Apate.</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>Please, let me hear you say it.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>I will bring the hierophant down.<br>
...However, I'm not going to rush
us headlong to our deaths.<br>
The reality is, we're outmatched
right now. Deeply so.</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>And your suggestion is...?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>We will leave Tartaros.<br>
In Glamorgan, we'll have the time and
freedom to build up our strength.<br>
And when the time comes, we'll come back
and drag them off their seats of power!</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>That would also give us time to figure out
who their spy is.<br>
Information is useless when the only way to
utilize it is to start a war.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>I have already talked it out with
Redbeard and Pericles.<br>
Well, I didn't tell them exactly what
the end goal is yet, but...<br>
Pericles would probably agree, and
Redbeard's Redbeard.<br>
Anyway, we will be ready to go in a
short while.<br>
You should get ready, too.<br>
It's going to be a quick march to
the frontier.</div>
