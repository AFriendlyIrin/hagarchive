<div>Finally! I was sick of pullin' tiny
branches outta my hair...</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>We are closer to the border than
I had anticipated.<br>
You have a keen sense of direction,
Dame Kyra.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>In return, will you please stop
calling me Dame Kyra?</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>Oh, er... I...<br>
Forgive me. I lived my entire life
in the capital, you see, and...</div>
<div>edward</div>

<div>......</div><div></div><div class="stagedirection">(Pericles shifts awkawrdly.)</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div><i>(grins)</i> Hah! Ahh, c'mon, don't make that
face, old boy!<br>
Remind me to buy you a drink when
we get to Glamorgan.<br>
I'll teach ya a lil' bit of commoner
etiquette.</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>Why, that... would be
nice, actually.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>...And with that riveting topic covered,
let's talk about getting out of here.<br>
All we have to do is cross the river and
we're good, right?</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>Be that it were so simple, but
I sincerely doubt it will be.<br>
Look... They await us.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>That's a lot of soldiers...</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>The twin bridges were projected as the
first line of defense against Glamorgan.<br>
The border watch will surely have been
warned of our approach.<br>
They will welcome us as they would a platoon
of southern invaders.</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>On top of that, just crossing the bridges
won't be enough.<br>
Tartaros actually has a tiny bit of territory
past the river.<br>
Nothing to write home about, but they got
a fort with its own garrison and all.<br>
It was all strongarmed from Glamorgan in
their last war.<br>
Way I've been told, they refused to return
it at the end.</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>A symbol of the theocracy's unstoppable
will. Anything they desire is theirs.<br>
As if to say, [OpenQuote]we are not beaten. This
peace, it is us that grant it to you.[CloseQuote]</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>Cutting the history lesson short,
what this all means is:<br>
We must cross the bridges,
survive the enemy onslaught,<br>
and seize the fort to prevent
their pursuit.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Sounds simple enough.<br>
The bridges were built to be easily
defended,<br>
but from Glamorgan, not escapees
on the inside.<br>
Besides, we've not come this far to
fall at the doorstep of our goal.<br>
Let's go, everyone! We'll prove that
Tartaros's will isn't unstoppable!</div>

<div>hestia</div>
<div>I'll take that as a compliment, but really,
it's not all great.<br>
For one, it... doesn't really fire a million
arrows.<br>
Just enough for a couple volleys before
the enemy knows what's what.<br>
Also, I had to haphazardly infuse a ton
of magic power into the poor thing.<br>
And now, well... It's difficult just to lift it.
Give it a try.</div>

My orders are twofold: First, return

However long it takes, you will bring
her back to Amnisos.<br>
Alive, if possible... But you shan't be
punished if you bring her head.</div>

And the second order?</div>
<div>dolus</div>

She must be stopped, no matter
