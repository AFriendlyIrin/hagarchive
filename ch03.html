So... Is this when I laugh and you
tell me what you actually need?</div>
				<div>apate</div>
				<div>Do I look like the kind of person
that jokes around?</div>
				<div>kyra</div>
				<div>That's what I was worried about...<br>
You do realize just how insane your
request is, right?<br>
It's not like my heart's filled with love
for the guy, but...<br>
I mean, suppose I decided to follow
through with it!<br>
How many times have people tried to
murder the hierophant?<br>
That kind of news reaches even this
tiny corner of the world.<br>
Almost as if they want to make sure
that everyone knows,<br>
to harm the hierophant is impossible
and trying only invites death!</div>
				<div>apate</div>
				<div>I am aware.<br>
But I cannot mix and match
the weak energies of many.<br>
It is not so simple.
There is but one way.<br>
His is the only lifeforce that
will suffice.</div>
				<div>kyra</div>
				<div>Why?
Why the hierophant?!<br>
Explain yourself! What does he
have that's so special?!<br>
Or do you just hold a grudge?
Want me to do your dirty work?!</div>
				<div>apate</div>
				<div>If you refuse, I shall take my
leave and disturb you no longer.<br>
But be warned, without my
intervention, soon your brother...<br>
<p class="stagedirection">(Pheme barges in.)</p></div>
				<div>pheme</div>
				<div>Kyra! Here you are...<br>
I think you'd better
come out!</div>
				<div>kyra</div>
				<div>Oh, for goodness'--
What's happening now?</div>
				<div>pheme</div>
				<div>I-It's better you see for
yourself... and fast.</div>
				<div>apate</div>

				<div>Sandraudiga</div>
				<div>Oh, I was in the area on unrelated
business. I figured I'd pass by.<br>
I've heard that this town is home to
quite the fascinating sights.<p>
I am the Grand Inquisitor of Tartaros,
Commander-in-chief of her armies,<br>
and a couple more titles that I won't
recite. I don't want to bore you.</p>
<p class="stagedirection">(Kyra starts.)</p></div>

				<div>Sandraudiga</div>
				<div>Hahaha, I do rather enjoy
that moniker.<br>
Sandraudiga's the name.
Charmed, I'm sure.</div>
				<div>kyra</div>
				<div>Well, uh... Er, it's not much,
but we got a little alehouse...<br>
You can have lunch on me.
The porkchops are quite--</div>
				<div>Sandraudiga</div>
				<div>Thank you for the offer! I hope we have
time to try those porkchops... later.<br>
But now, all I wish is to walk around.
Take in the sights of this quaint village.<br>
The capital may seem so grandiose and
opulent, but it gets old, you know?<br>
This will be a welcome change of pace.</div>
				<div>kyra</div>
				<div>...Would you please stop that and
just tell me what you want?</div>
				<div>Sandraudiga</div>
				<div>Ohh, touchy! Fine, I will get straight
to the unpleasant part.<br>
In the capital all I see are sprawling
cathedrals and tacky palaces...<br>
Today I think I'd like to see what a
mercenary guild looks like inside.<br>
What kind of people it houses...
Things like that.</div>
				<div>kyra</div>
				<div>......<br>
Now's not a good time.</div>
				<div>Sandraudiga</div>

I am looking for a friend.<br>
She's a bit of a scatterbrain.
Got lost on us.<br>

ebony hair, white robes.<br>
Ring a bell?</p></div>
				<div>kyra</div>
				<div>...No.</div>

				<div>You hesitated for a brief moment,

				<div>T-That cannot be!
Surely that's not it, Apate!<br>
She's the Grand Inquisitor. No doubt

In any case, we have not the time
