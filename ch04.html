I'll explain later.<br>
But yeah, we're going to

We'll lay low there for a

						<div>Deep in the forest, off the

It ain't a luxury palace, but
it gets the job done.</div>

						<div>Oddly magnanimous of ye,
don't you think?</div>
						<div>Begoña</div>
						<div>Hey, least I could do! We're
all in this together now!<br>
Rogues oughta look out for
other rogues, no?</div>
						<div>kyra</div>
						<div>Don't compare us, Begoña.<br>
We only wanted to free innocents
from wrongful imprisonment.</div>
						<div>Begoña</div>
						<div>Yeah, yeah... But ya got yer
own reasons, doncha?<br>
Don't lie t'me.
I won't judge or anything.</div>
						<div>edward</div>
						<div>I can't believe I'm about to say
this, but I agree with her.<br>

helped us...<br>
We owe you our thanks.</div>
					<div>pericles</div>
					<div>We have precious little time.
Let us not waste it on pleasantries.<br>
My name is Pericles.
Behind me is Hestia.</div>
					<div>hestia</div>
					<div>A pleasure.</div>
					<div>pericles</div>
					<div>And that there is--</div>
					<div>agari</div>
					<div><i>(smiles)</i> Call me Agari! It's great
to meet you all.</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>So, what's your deal?<br>
You're not the kind of people one expects
to orchestrate a prison break.</div>
					<div>pericles</div>
					<div>As I am sure you have already deduced,
I was a holy knight.<br>
I once believed ours to be a beautiful
nation, worthy of our pride.<br>
But that beauty does not run deep.
At its core, Tartaros is rotten.</div>
					<div>agari</div>
					<div>The inquisition tyrannically watches
and lords over the people.<br>
Daily, “heretics” are taken to the
capital, never to return.<br>
Ugly stuff. Once you open your eyes,
you can never go back.</div>
					<div>pericles</div>
					<div>And go back we never shall!<br>
We strive to reshape Tartaros
for the better.<br>
Until it is every bit as beautiful
as it deserves to be!</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>...That's a nice speech. It'd probably
work on the likes of Soter.<br>
But none of that changes the fact
that you're obviously desperate.<br>
You were trying to break potential
allies out of the dungeon.</div>
					<div>pericles</div>
					<div>Er, well...</div>
					<div>hestia</div>
					<div>On top of the inquisition breathing
down everyone's necks,<br>
there are a lot of true believers out
there.<br>
Folks just don't see much of a reason
to go against the grain.<br>
So, in so many words, yes.
You're right. We're desperate.</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>For the time being, you can
tag along with us.<br>
We're going to hide for some
time.<br>
I hope we can fit all of you in
the fort...<br>
How many can we expect?</div>
					<div>agari</div>
					<div>Just the three of us, but you'll be
real glad to have us!<br>
My dad's the greatest knight in the
realm,<br>
Hestia's an awesome blacksmith,
and I'm a quick learner!<br>
We're going to be close like sisters
before long, just you wait!</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>......<br>
Very well. Can't say no to more
help under the circumstances.</div>
					<div>pericles</div>

you out back there.<br>
Guessing you're the one calling
the shots?</div>
					<div>kyra</div>

companions?<br>
I owe them my thanks.</div>
					<div>hestia</div>

guy with the stache...<br>
Well, the young squire was
his daughter.<br>
He's... taking his time, right
now.</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>O-Oh...<br>
She... She fell during our
escape, didn't she?<br>
I'm so sorry...
I didn't...<br>
Is there anything we
could do for you?</div>
					<div>hestia</div>
					<div>Truth is, we fancy ourselves a
rebellion against the theocracy.<br>
...Haven't had much luck finding
more rebels, though.<br>
The inquisition breathes down
everyone's necks,<br>
and there are a lot of true
believers out there besides.<br>
Folks just don't see much of a

It was just us three.<br>
So two, now.</div>
					<div>kyra</div>
					<div>......<br>
Very well. Can't say no to more
help under the circumstances.</div>
					<div>hestia</div>
					<div>Don't worry about Peri.
I'll take care of him.<br>
Just...
Give him some room.</div>

Don't keep me away.<br>
You're my friend, Kyra.
I want to be there for you!</div>
				<div>kyra</div>

You can come along if you want.<br>
As long as you're careful.
You're no fighter, and--</div>
