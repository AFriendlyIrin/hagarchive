ago by Dolus I, who would be
its first hierophant.<br>

the Church of Anima, which

the blessing of the elements,<br>
it is a powerful and prideful
nation that rewards fidelity
and harshly punishes all that
is deemed heretical.<br>
The current hierophant,
Dolus IV, inherits his sacred
bloodline's duty to protect
the country's way of life.<br>
By mean of the order of the
holy knights, the inquisition,
he stamps out dissidence
