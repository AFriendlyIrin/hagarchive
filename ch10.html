<div>This has gone on long enough,
don't you think?<br>
Give it up or we might have to
break a few bones.</div>
<div>polonius</div>
<div>Heh heh heh heh... Such threatening words.
But can you back them up with power?<br>
I can. I have more power than each and
every one of you combined!<br>
Writhe in despair and tremble in terror,
as I unleash upon you...<br>
The armies of the damned!
<p class="stagedirection">(Four revenants and one entombed appear seemingly out of nowhere. Apate steps forward.)</p></div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>What treachery is this?</div>
<div>Kyra</div>
<div>Treachery? Sorcery!
He... He truly can revive the dead!</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>Have you taken leave of your
senses, Kyra?! Come now!</div>
<div>Kyra</div>
<div>Apate, why are you being so
stubborn?! Just look at them!<br>
They're rotting away, yet they're
standing up!<br>
What other explanation could
there be, if not magic?!</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>......<br>
Explain yourself, miscreant!
What have you done?</div>
<div>polonius</div>
<div>Eeheeheeheehee...
Heh heh heh...<br>
I am truly pleased to have garnered
your admiration, my friends!<br>
And that's not all - I still have some
mercenaries left in my employ!<br>
Mercenaries thirsty for the blood of
their leader's murderers!<br>
I shall, however, be magnanimous, and
grant you one final chance.<br>
Turn back and leave now, and tell the
villagers to pay up their dues!<br>
Lest we attack with the fury of a
thousand maelstroms!</div>
<div>Kyra</div>
<div>Wait, what? You'd still insist on
petty thievery?<br>
Wait! We're not done talking!
<p class="stagedirection">(Polonius teleports away and the undead scatter throughout the castle. Kyra tries to lunge for them, but to no avail.)</p></div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>Is there no end to this nightmare?<br>
How many more unfathomable abilities
does this man possess?!</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>...Hmmm...</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>Edward? You appear
deep in thought.</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Just a hunch, but uh...<br>
I'm thinkin' there's something very
strange about those guys.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Apart from the whole “corpses standing
up and threatening to fight us” thing?</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>No, actually, that's just the thing...<br>
They sure were threatening, weren't
they?<br>
Standing there all menacingly while
the bloke cackled at us.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>What are you getting at,
Redbeard?</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>All I'm saying is, let's not be
too hasty, okay?</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>Even you speak in riddles now,
sailor?</div>
<div></div><div class="stagedirection">(Edward becomes agitated.)</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Enough already! Who told you I was
ever a sailor?<br>
And besides, I really don't think what
I said is that hard to understand!</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>Too much is blanketed in a deep
fog of uncertainty.<br>
Caution is imperative in such a
situation. Do you not agree?</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>Caution?!
We are in mortal peril!<br>
We need to kill those...
things, before they kill us!</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>All right, that's enough bickering
from all of you!<br>
The mercenaries are popping
out of the woodwork too!<br>
However we choose to proceed,
we have to do it fast!</div>

			<div data-role="collapsible" class="collapsible" data-collapsed="true"><h1>Hestia</h1>
				<div class="container">
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Hey there, Hestia...</div>
<div>hestia</div>
<div>Kyra? What's on your
mind, girl?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Well, I'm just now realizing, I
don't know much about you.</div>
<div>hestia</div>
<div>Yeah, that's true. We did just
sort of waltz into your life.<br>
What would you like to know,
then? Ask away.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>I guess the obvious question is why
you left the theocracy.<br>
I can't imagine it was lack of money
or poor work conditions.<br>
You wouldn't need to do... unsavory
things, like the knights do, either.</div>
<div>hestia</div>
<div>Yeah, it was a really cozy job.<br>
Made tons of weapons and armor, day in,
day out, got paid a mountain of gold.<br>
Honestly, it was just Pericles. I wasn't
gonna let him and his kid go off alone.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>I guess you were good friends
with Agari, huh.</div>
<div>hestia</div>
<div>Well, actually, first I was friends
with Pericles.<br>
We met when I was an apprentice
and he was a rising star.<br>
I was... a different person.
We became fast friends.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>I'm guessing he wasn't the way
he is now back then.</div>
<div>hestia</div>
<div>Oh no, he was in his prime.
Beyond spirited, devoted to a fault...<br>
Many called him the ideal of a knight.<br>
Some even thought he might make
Grand Inquisitor one day.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Yeah, that's about what I've
heard and could've figured.</div>
<div>hestia</div>
<div>The next question would be
what changed, wouldn't it?<br>
...I'm afraid I won't speak for
him. Sorry.<br>
I can tell you this, though...
It was partly because of me.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>How so?<br>
Ah, sorry. I'm starting to
pry, aren't I...</div>
<div>hestia</div>
<div>I don't mind. We're just getting
to know each other better.<br>
I might tell you the whole thing
some other time, but for now...<br>
Suffice to say, I changed.
It was a... big change.<br>
It made him reconsider a few
things, when he found out.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>That's rather vague.
And ominous.</div>
<div>hestia</div>
<div><i>(smiles)</i> But enough about me.
Now it's my turn to be nosy.<br>
So, do you like boys or girls?</div>
<div></div><div class="stagedirection">(Kyra starts.)</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>W-What kind of a first question
is that?!<br>
I've never really... had the time,
you know.<br>
I never really cared when I was
growing up.<br>
And just when I was starting to
get there, Mom and Dad died.<br>
Ever since I've just taken care of
Elias and protected Percote.</div>
<div>hestia</div>
<div>I see...
Shame.<br>
<i>(smiles)</i> Well, if you figure it out, I want to
be the first to know, all right?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div><i>(smiling)</i> ...Y-Yeah. Sure.</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div data-role="collapsible" class="collapsible" data-collapsed="true"><h1>Tiresias</h1>
				<div class="container">
<div>tiresias</div>
<div>Mm... That's not quite...
So then, this... Hmm...</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Tiresias.</div>
<div></div><div class="stagedirection">(Tiresias startles.)</div>
<div>tiresias</div>
<div>Gahh!<br>
Ah, do forgive me, Kyra.
I didn't know you were there.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>I-I apologize...
I forgot...</div>
<div>tiresias</div>
<div><i>(smiles)</i> No harm done. It takes time
to adapt, I know.<br>
What was it that you wished
to speak with me about?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>I'm wondering about what you're
doing.<br>
Just curiosity, that's all.</div>
<div>tiresias</div>
<div><i>(grins)</i> You should be wary. A heretic's
secrets can be quite terrifying.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Oh, please. Apate's terrifying.
You're a cinnamon roll.</div>
<div>tiresias</div>
<div>I won't argue with you there.
That woman unnerves me.<br>
I have tried conversing with her,
you know.<br>
I figured we might have common
ground, given our... predispositions.<br>
I didn't need sight to tell she was
glaring a hole through my skull.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>That's Apate, all right.
Don't take it personally.<br>
You know how parents tell their
kids to stop scowling,<br>
or their face will stay that way?
There's the living example.</div>
<div>tiresias</div>
<div>Ahahahaha! Don't let her hear
you said that, Kyra!<br>
She'd do the lifewringing with
her bare hands!</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>I can believe that.<br>
So, about that research of
yours... Do you mind?</div>
<div>tiresias</div>
<div>Not at all, though I would advise against
trying to read my tomes.<br>
Not because there's anything particularly
private in them,<br>
they're just not books written to be read
with the eyes, you understand.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Well, why don't you tell me, then?</div>
<div>tiresias</div>
<div>Have you heard of the forbidden
magics?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>The magic arts of the
lifewringers?<br>
Everyone's got some vague
idea of them.<br>
If only that the theocracy
says it's very bad stuff.</div>
<div>tiresias</div>
<div>I have been attempting to rescue the
reviled arts from the clutches of time.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Oh, wow... No wonder you had
to escape Tartaros.<br>
That's definitely not something
they'd allow.</div>
<div>tiresias</div>
<div>You said it. Alas, curiosity
doth kill the cat.<br>
<i>(smiles)</i> On the other hand, leaving
led me to Wulfric.<br>
And now, to you. So I'd
say it all turned out well.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div><i>(smiles)</i> ...Goodness, your optimism is something else.
You're just such a breath of fresh air!<br>
After Apate, it's nice to know a so-called
heretic that's just a pleasant fellow.</div>
<div>tiresias</div>
<div>I'll take that as a compliment, but let
me just say...<br>
Being a heretic is not where a heretic
begins and ends.<br>
I could tell from our short chats that
Apate is a haunted soul.<br>
I don't know what happened to her...
But she has suffered. Greatly.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>...You're right, yeah.<br>
Thanks for the pearl of
wisdom, Tiresias.</div>
<div>tiresias</div>
<div><i>(smiles)</i> Any time, my friend.
Any time.</div>

	So he started writing. First poems, then

	He got really into the plays. He even

the whole concept.<br>

I'm sorry.</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Nah, it was a reasonable

Er, reasonable in this

You really miss 'em,
don't ya?<br>
...Bah, what a stupid thing
to ask. 'Course you do.<br>
Damn, I still miss my ma, and
she died 14 years ago!</div>
<div>elias</div>
<div>Oh... Sorry... I didn't
mean to remind you...</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>It was just a regular,
peaceful death.<br>
She lived her life.
Don't worry about it.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>...Unlike our parents.</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>O-Oh, but there's no need to
talk about this topic, guys.</div>
<div>elias</div>
<div>Actually, we never did tell you
how they died, did we?</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Oi! What did I just say?
How's it any of my business?<br>
There's a reason I've never
asked, kids.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Some stupid traveling merchant had
one too many at the alehouse.<br>
He went to leave and whipped his horse
so hard, the poor thing panicked.<br>
Threw him into a trough and took off
running like its life depended on it.<br>
...Our parents were walking back home.
It was just a dumb accident...</div>
<div>elias</div>
<div>It was my fault, too.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Elias! How many times must
I tell you that's not true?</div>

sick, they wouldn't have...</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Elias, this really should go without
saying,<br>
but you can't blame yourself for
some jerk having no restraint.<br>
C'mon, a boy your age shouldn't
have that kind of regrets.</div>
<div>elias</div>
<div>I know all of that. I keep telling myself,
over and over.<br>
I just... feel like such a burden.<br>
Our parents died because they left
the house for me.<br>
You risked your life to get me out of
that prison.<br>
And don't even get me started on all
Kyra's been through for my sake.<br>
Everyone's always suffering because
I'm here!<br>
And for what?! We all know that I'm
just going to d--</div>

<div>Dammit...
Dammit! What have I done?!</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Don't you start too.
It's not your fault.<br>
All this is clearly taking a toll
on him...<br>

<div>...Can you translate for us?</div>
<div>ofelia</div>
<div>You killed our associates.
He was trying not to show it, but...<br>
He will never be able to assist those
who murdered them.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>And you can?</div>
<div>ofelia</div>
<div>This is our own fault.
We asked for trouble, and we got it.<br>
Now I have to try to keep the rest of
us out of the dungeon.<br>
...Please. I swear I'll be helpful. Just
give the rest a second chance.</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Er, well... Kyra, if you ask me,
I'm tempted to agree.<br>
They've learned their lesson.
It's cost them, after all...</div>

This is how the inquisition operates.<br>

threatened.<br>
