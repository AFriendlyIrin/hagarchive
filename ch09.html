<div>kyra</div>
<div>What can we expect, Fiadh?</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>A farce, that's what.
These idiots are all bark and no bite.<br>
An army of the “undead,” right.
Where'd they pull that crud from?<br>
What do you think, expert heretic?
Sounds like anything to you?</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>It sounds profoundly stupid.</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>Exactly.
And look at this nonsense!<br>
Old ruins, abandoned castle, dark
woods... The whole nine yards.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>It seems... cliché, doesn't it?</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>Like any mediocre book about
lifewringers and death cults.</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>It's only missing the head honcho using
magic to appear from thin air.<br>
Just so he can gloat at us and leave
without actually doing anything.
<p class="stagedirection">(A spellsword teleports in front of them.)</p></div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>What do you know. Turns out I'm
the sorcerer. I can see the future.</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>How can you be so calm?!
We have just witnessed...<br>
Teleportation...
Forbidden arts!<br>
Who are you?!
State your name!</div>
<div>polonius</div>
<div><i>(grinning madly)</i> Eeheeheehee! I am Polonius,
the great necromancer!<br>
Are you trembling yet? You
should start right about now!<br>
My powers are beyond the
comprehension of feeble worms!</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Since you look like a... very decent
fellow, I'll try asking nicely first.<br>
Grab your posse of the “undead”
or whatever and get lost.</div>
<div>polonius</div>
<div><i>(still grinning)</i> Fools... Don't you know who I am?</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>You just told us, moron.</div>
<div>polonius</div>
<div><i>(still grinning)</i> Heh heh heh... You are about to witness
a power that will leave you astounded!<br>
But first, a test, if you will. Survive, and
I shall reward you with my attention!<br>
Eeheeheehee! Dead or alive, I shall see
you on the other side!
<p class="stagedirection">(Polonius teleports away.)</p></div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>Aaaand what did I tell you?
Gloated and left.<br>
I'm already looking forward to
putting an arrow in his butt.</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div><i>(smiles)</i> I don't know, I'm actually
having fun with this.<br>
It's like watching a bad play,
but we're in it!</div>
<div></div><div class="stagedirection">(Pericles sputters.)</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>I am surrounded by-- Can you not grasp
the gravity of the situation?!<br>
The man can teleport!
A feat thought lost to time!<br>
He is not just a heretic, he is...
T-The heretic-in-chief!</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Huh. I always thought that
would have to be Apate.<br>
Say, Apate! Why don't you
try teleporting around too?<br>
That'd be a pretty handy
power to have.</div>
<div>apate</div>
<div>This charade is trying my
patience.<br>
Let us apprehend the clown
and be done with it.</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>Finally, someone with a sense of urgency.<br>
The sooner we wrap up, the sooner I can
get back to the margrave.<br>
The sooner I'm back, the less risk that I'll
find him dead.</div>
<div>edward</div>
<div>Can't argue with that,
I guess.<br>
Shall we see what's in
store for us, Kyra?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>To the castle it is.<br>
Be careful, everyone. The woods
are rather dense here.<br>
There may be enemies waiting
to ambush us amid the trees.</div>

<div>hestia</div>
<div>Now that Tiresias is here, maybe

Then again, I don't want to distract
him from his research.</div>

Yeah, you'd like one of those, wouldn't
you, Kyra?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>You can just make them?</div>
<div>hestia</div>
<div><i>(smirks)</i> What, you thought people get them

Someone's got to make 'em.
I never have, myself, but...<br>

				<div class="container">
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Hello, Fiadh.</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>......</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>...Er...
So. How's it hanging?</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>It's hanging.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Right, right...
<p>
......</p></div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>......<br>
I'm making you uncomfortable,
aren't I?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Is it that obvious?</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>Well, it's what I'm trying
to do.<br>
I want you to be afraid
of me. Just a little bit.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>...Mind telling me why?</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>I don't know yet what you
intend to pull here.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Didn't the margrave get you up to
speed before we set out?<br>
We're trying to bring the hierophant
of Tartaros to justice, and--</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>Yes, I know what you claim
to be your goal.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>You don't trust us, do you?</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>The margrave has often told me of his
dear friend, Edward.<br>
He vouches for him, and by extension,
the rest of you.<br>
...That is why I cannot afford to trust
you.<br>
It shocks me that he doesn't see this
for the blind spot that it is.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Wow, you're paranoid.<br>
If we had any ulterior motives, why not
just let you all die to those assassins?</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>It doesn't have to be all of you.<br>
If the margrave says Edward is
trustworthy, I believe him.<br>
Edward says you're trustworthy.
I could believe him, too.<br>
You say that cantankerous hag of
yours is trustworthy.<br>
The hag isn't worried about the
knight stabbing her in the back.<br>
Then there's the whole jolly cadre
you've brought along.<br>
This chain of trust is far too long,
with far too many links.<br>
Can you guarantee to me that
none of those links will break?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>......<br>
Okay, I do have to admit, I see
your point, but none of us...</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>Were you about to assure me that none
of you could possibly be a traitor?<br>
Stopping halfway through such a sentence
says more than any words ever could.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>There are... suspicions. But if anyone's
getting stabbed in the back, it's us.<br>
I doubt anybody here holds any grudges
against the margrave.</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>You doubt it, just like I doubt
everything you just said.<br>
So just in case, I'm going to
keep glaring at everyone.<br>
<i>[narrows eyes]</i> So they know my arrows will land in
some very uncomfortable places,<br>
should anyone harbor any funny
ideas towards my liege.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>You keep at it.</div>
<div>fiadh</div>
<div>...Make no mistake, though. So far as none
of you give me cause to oppose you,<br>
my bow arm will follow your say, and my
arrows will find only your foes' flesh.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>That's something, at least.</div>

<div>soter</div>
<div><i>(smiling)</i> Kyra, my fair companion!
How fare you today?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div><i>(smiling)</i> Better now that we're out
of the lion's den, Soter.<br>
<i>(serious)</i> But not as well as I'll be
when this is all over.</div>
<div>soter</div>
<div>Indeed, indeed...
Alas, that goes without saying.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>What were you two doing?
Recounting old war stories?</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>He and I are the only proper holy
knights in our midst, if only formerly.<br>
Regardless of how it ended for both
of us, it was a part of our lives.<br>
Soter sought me out, seeking to
indulge in some reminiscing.</div>
<div>soter</div>
<div>I get nostalgic, Kyra.
It is common, at our age.<br>
Sometimes I yearn for days
long past...</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>...I must admit that I differ.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Wait, you're not the nostalgic
type, Pericles?<br>
That's a surprise. I thought it
lined up with the rest of... uh...</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>Do not sugarcoat it, Kyra.
I know who I am.<br>
But no, I do not count wistfulness
among my many flaws.<br>
Truth be told, Pericles, the undyingly
loyal holy knight of an era bygone...<br>
is perhaps the person I despise the
most in the entire world.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Whoa... Strong words.
Grandiloquent, but strong.<br>
Is that why you've such a chip on
your shoulder about the theocracy?</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>...I mislike this topic. Could we please
speak of brighter matters?</div>
<div>soter</div>
<div><i>(smiles)</i> Verily! Where was I before our
friend interrupted us?<br>
Ah, yes. I was speaking of
that one mission.<br>
A group of heretics was
somewhere in the capital.<br>
We were tasked with reigning
them in.<br>
You would not believe where
they attempted to hide!</div>
<div>pericles</div>
<div>......<br>
Pardon me. I... I feel a tad
lightheaded.<br>
Perhaps it is what we had
for supper...<br>
I will excuse myself now.<p class="stagedirection">(Pericles leaves.)</p></div>
<div>soter</div>
<div>...I-Is it something I said?</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>I don't think his memories of the inquisition
are as fond as yours, Soter...</div>
<div>soter</div>
<div>I would not exactly call them fond, Kyra.
I did leave, after all.<br>
But yes, I must concede that I do not
bear his burning hatred for my old life.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>I cannot help but wonder what
went down.<br>
It must've been something bad,
to cause such resentment.<br>
Who wronged this man?</div>
<div>soter</div>
<div>Perhaps nobody wronged him at all.
Regret takes many forms, Kyra.<br>
The work of a holy knight often
called for difficult decisions.<br>
'Tis why I departed. There were
orders I could not abide.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>So you think he did abide them,
and now he...?</div>
<div>soter</div>
<div>......<br>
I merely ramble, as I tend to do.
I do not know him well enough.</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>Well, he'll have to sort out his demons
on his own. We can't help him there.<br>
But we can help him with his quest
to make this world a better place.<br>
There we are of identical minds,
through and through.</div>
<div>soter</div>
<div>I, too, shall do my part.
To right the wrongs of the past...</div>
<div>kyra</div>
<div>I'm counting on you as always,
Soter.<br>
Better not get distracted by
memories on the field.</div>
<div>soter</div>
<div><i>(smiles)</i> It upsets me that you believe there
is any need to remark that!

<div>I'm not surprised you lost. Those heretics
are something else.<br>
They left a trail of bodies throughout the
forest on their way to you, you know.<br>
They're a force to be reckoned with, and
no doubt. This'll be an interesting hunt...</div>
<div>pedro</div>
<div>The rest of the border watch awaits
orders. What would you have us do?</div>
<div>sandraudiga</div>
<div>Go back to the capital with the rest of
the late general's division.<br>
We are taking over. This is a matter of
such gravity, it warrants drastic action.</div>
<div>pedro</div>
<div>Yes, my lady.</div>
<div></div><div class="stagedirection">(Pedro leaves.)</div>
<div>sandraudiga</div>
<div>Lorenzo, where is Euryma?</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="container">
<div>euryma</div>
<div>Right here, my lady!
Awaiting orders!</div>
<div>sandraudiga</div>
<div>And you'll keep awaiting them.
For now we'll just sit tight.<br>
Lorenzo, what have we heard from
our friend on the other side?</div>
<div>lorenzo</div>
<div>The last report claimed the heretic and
her cohorts were nearing Wrexham Keep.</div>
<div>sandraudiga</div>
<div>Going straight to the keep?
Weird.</div>
<div>euryma</div>
<div>Surely they're not entertaining the idea
of enlisting Glamorgan's help, right?<br>
They cannot be that naïve.</div>
<div>sandraudiga</div>
<div>They've proven impossibly
bold thus far.<br>
We better not put anything
past them.</div>
<div>euryma</div>
<div>The only thing we know for sure is that
they will try to return in time.<br>
Will we fall upon them when they attempt
to cross the border?</div>
<div>lorenzo</div>
<div>That would appear to be the best
course of action, and yet...<br>
They won't try without being
confident in their odds.<br>
However we choose to proceed,
they will not be easily defeated.</div>
<div>sandraudiga</div>
<div>Hmmm...</div>
